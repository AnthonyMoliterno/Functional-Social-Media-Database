Project Overview: Social Media Database Management System

Project Name: SocialMediaDB

Description
SocialMediaDB is a database management system designed to simulate the core functionalities of a social media platform. It models user interactions such as creating posts, commenting, liking posts, and following other users. The goal of this project is to build a robust, normalized relational database capable of managing the relationships between users and their activities in a social media environment. The focus is on efficiently storing and querying data related to users, posts, comments, likes, and followers.

Key Features
User Management: Store and manage user profiles, including usernames, email addresses, and account creation dates.
Post Creation: Users can create posts, each linked to the user who created it.
Commenting System: Users can comment on posts, with each comment linked to both the post and the user.
Like System: Users can like posts, with each like associated with the post and the user.
Follow System: Users can follow other users, enabling the tracking of relationships and interactions.
Database Structure
The database consists of five main tables:

Users: Stores user information, including unique user IDs, usernames, email addresses, and account creation dates.
Posts: Stores posts created by users, including content, post dates, and associated user IDs.
Comments: Stores comments on posts, including comment text, comment dates, and links to the post and user.
Likes: Records likes on posts, tracking which user liked which post and when.
Followers: Tracks follow relationships between users.
Technologies Used
SQL (Structured Query Language): Used for defining the database schema and performing data manipulation operations.
Relational Database Design: Ensures data consistency, normalization, and efficient querying.
Project Files
